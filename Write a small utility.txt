Write a small utility that adds an element to a database table, in Python using SQLAlchemy ORM. It should read a Pickle file (with the elements to add) and a SQLite database. It should be interactive and for each element in the Pickle file: 1) it displays the title field of the element, 2) it display fields not in the table and ask for a corresponding field in the table, 3) prompt for required fields in the table, 3) and finally append the element to the table.
